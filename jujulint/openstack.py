"""OpenStack checks module.

This module provides checks for OpenStack clouds.

Attributes:
     access (string): Set the access method (local/ssh)
     ssh_host (string, optional): Configuration to pass to Cloud module for accessing the cloud via SSH
     ssh_jump (string, optional): Jump/Bastion configuration to pass to Cloud module for access the cloud via SSH
     sudo_user (string, optional): User to switch to via sudo when accessing the cloud, passed to the Cloud module

Todo:
    * Pass connection information to underlying cloud module
    * Get parsed bundle from Cloud module
    * Check neutron configuration
      * Check MTU configuration on neutron-api and OVS charms
      * Check neutron units interface config for MTU settings
      * Check namespaces and MTUs within namespaces
      * Check OpenStack network definitions for MTU mismatches
    * Check nova configuration for live migration settings
    * Check Ceph for sensible priorities
